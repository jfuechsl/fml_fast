is a must read for anyone interested in quantitative trading.

All credit for the algorithms, concepts, and original implementation goes to him.

This repository hosts a small selection of code from this book,
along with faster implementations (in Cython).

It may contain bugs and you are responsible for reviewing and testing it before using it in any critical applications.

### Setup
Running `python setup.py build_ext --inplace` should compile the cython code into importable modules.

### Requirements
